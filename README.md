# Statiko

A node package allows you to host the static API on github pages. This package aims at automating every step involved in this process.

Currently in development. I would love to have this tested till this point to see if there are any issues.

## To Test it

* Create a blank git project.
* Link it with repository on github.com
* run ```npm install -g statiko```
* run ```statiko install``` to install statiko files on your project
* create any file inside any directory within the project
* commit your changes
* run ```statiko make``` to create APIs

### Any bugs reports will be helpful to improve this.

## WIP [ALPHA]
